<h3>About me (non work-related)</h3>
<p>I am a proud lifelong Oregonian and 20 year resident of the Portland area.</p>
<p>When I'm not writing software I enjoy several hobbies including: hiking, camping, walking my dog, gardening, home improvement, motorcycle riding (streetbike), listening to podcasts, binge-watching Netflix, grilling meat, and playing the occasional video game.</p>
