			<p>Over my twenty-five year career as a developer I have learned many lessons that I apply to every project I take on. I subscribe to the prinipals of DRY (don't repeat yourself), DRTW (don't reinvent the wheel), and KISS (keep it simple (<em>stupid</em>)).</p>
			<p>I believe the complexity is the enemy of reliability and that it's better to be smart than clever in most situations. Having spent years working on inherited code I am mindful of the code legacy I am leaving behind.</p>
			<p>With so much time in this field I have a very pragmatic attitude towards the balance between writing elegent code and just getting it done. I have a firm grasp on the efemeral nature of code and know that no matter how good the code is it will likely be removed or refactored as business needs change. In short, I write the best code I can but avoid becoming too atached.</p>
