What's with the name?!?

The phrase was used by Stephen Hawking in 1988, but has been commonly known since at least the early 20th century. A comparable metaphor describing the circular cause and consequence for the same problem is the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_and_egg_problem">chicken and egg problem</a>". The same problem in epistemology is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma">MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma</a>.
